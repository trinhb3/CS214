so far, ass1.c iterates through the argv vector using a pointer and searches for the -c, -d and -o flags 
  and their corresponding input arguments. The input arguments are copied into 3 strings and printed out
  so you can see what they are.The flags will be later used to determine how the scanning process 
  will occur while the input arguments will determine where the scanning process will occur
